We don't know how to pray
We don't know what to say
We don't know how to make it through another day
Never run, never hide
Always up for the fight
We keep getting it wrong until we get it right

We don't know how to pray
We don't know what to say
We don't know how to make it through another day
Never run, never hide
Always up for the fight
We keep getting it wrong until we get it right
